# Wawanesa Projects

This repository contains three automation projects developed as volunteer work to improve efficiency and streamline processes for the team at Wawanesa. Each project aims to save time and reduce manual efforts.

## Projects

### 1. Auto-Upload-Return-Mails
This project automates the process of uploading return mails to the company's internal system. By automating this task, it significantly reduces the time and effort required to handle return mails manually.

### 2. Email-JIRA-Creator
This project automates the creation of tickets by sending return mails from a specified folder to a designated email address. This automation speeds up the ticket creation process, especially when dealing with a large number of return mails.

### 3. Return-Mail-Report
This project generates a report by analyzing return mails and address changes over the last six months. It identifies and counts requests, highlighting those still marked as "DO NOT MAIL." This report helps in tracking and managing return mail statuses efficiently.

## Purpose
These projects were created as volunteer work to automate repetitive tasks and enhance the speed and efficiency of the team's workflow at Wawanesa. They demonstrate a commitment to improving operational processes and contributing to the team's success.
